## Introduction

Contributions:

1. Provide a consistent comparative analysis of several representative few-shot classification algorithms, with result showing that deeper backbones significantly reduce the performance differences among methods on datasets with limited domain differences.
2. Present a baseline method that achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art on both the miniImageNet and the CUB datasets.
3. Investigate an experimental setting for evaluating the cross-domain generalization ability for few-shot classification algorithms.
